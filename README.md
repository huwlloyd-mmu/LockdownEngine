# LockdownEngine
A 2D game engine, developed alongside my submissions to a series of Covid-19 lockdown game jams.

Engine is in folder __Engine__ 

Games will appear in folders __LJ1__, __LJ2__... Each will have it's own frozen in time version of the engine included when finished so I don't need to worry about backward compatibility in the engine development.

Dependencies - assumes SFML-2.5.1 is installed in the same top level folder as _LockdownEngine_

Not including game data for any of these - this will be on the associated itch.io page

### Games

__LJ1__: A bubble burst game, for the first theme 'Power of 2'.  [Game Page](https://hml.itch.io/2048buster)
