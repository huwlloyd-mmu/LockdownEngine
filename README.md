# LockdownEngine
A 2D game engine, developed alongside my submissions to a series of Covid-19 lockdown game jams.

Engine is in folder __Engine__ 

Games appear in folders LJ1, LJ2... Each will have it's own frozen in time version of the engine included when finished so I don't need to worry about backward compatibility in the engine development

Dependencies - assumes SFML-2.5.1 is installed in the same top level folder as _LockdownEngine_

Games:

LJ1: A bubble burst game, for the first theme 'Power of 2'.  [Game Page]{https://hml.itch.io/2048buster}
